title: "Assignment 4: Milestone 3 and Team Posters"
---

Due: [See the Assignments page for due dates](../assign/index.html)

# Your task

Your first task is to demonstrate your progress on your Milestone 3 requirements.  You or your group should be prepared to

* Demonstrate a working implementation of features addressing the Milestone 3 requirements
* Be prepared to discuss the design, implementation, and testing of these features

To facilitate discussion of your design, you should be prepared to present a UML model of important aspects of your problem domain and system.

In addition, you should document your individual contributions to the project.  If you are working on an individual project, you don't need to do anything special, since your commit history will be sufficient.  If you are working on a team project, your commit history can be sufficient if most of your contributions are associated with your user identity.  If some substantial fraction of your contributions are *not* associated with your user identity (for example, because you participated in pair programming, and most of your contributions were commited by a teammate), then you should keep a detailed log of your contributions and the associated code commits.

Your second task is to document requirements to be addressed in [Milestone 4](assign05.html), which is *the final milestone*.  You should create a new milestone (i.e., for Milestone 4) in your issue tracker, document requirements as issues in the form of use cases or user stories, and associate the issues with Milestone 4.

# Deliverables
You will be conducting this milestone presentation in conjunction with the Radio Telescope Engineering Capstone presentatio and demo.  As such, you mmust your integrate and coordinate your presentation and demo with their's.  We will be rehearsing parts of the presentation and demo during the Wednesday class session immediately prior to this milestone presentation.

You must develop **team posters**, ""presentations**, and **demos** to be presented at the annual **Engineering and Computer Science Expo**, which will be held on Thursday, 5-2-2019 from 2:00 to 6:30 in Kinsley.  **I strongly suggest that you make arrangements with your other professors ahead of time to be excused from any classes you might have that day - as you will likely need the time for final preparations for the E&CS Expo**.  The posters are due (printed and mounted on poster board) in class on Wednesday, 5-1-2019.  That class session will be used to rehearse your presentations and demos for the E&CS Expo the next day.

The only other specific deliverables for this assignment are the demonstration (including UML model, DB schema, and block diagrams of inter-related parts), documentation of individual progress, and documentation of requirements to be addressed in the final milestone.
