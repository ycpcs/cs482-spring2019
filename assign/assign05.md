Report: due Friday, May 4th by 11:59 PM

Demos, self/peer evaluation: Monday, May 7th, 12:45-2:45 PM (final exam time)

# Your task

Your main task is to demonstrate the final version of your project.  The demonstration should focus on the features addressing the requirements for Milestone 4, but should also incorporate important features from previous milestones in order to give an overall assessment of what your system is capable of.

You or your group are also resposible for writing a 3-4 page report documenting what you accomplished.  The report should focus on what you learned in the experience of working on the project.  Suggested outline:

* Background and problem description
* Overview of design
* Implementation experience
* Assessment of final product

Use Google Docs to write the report.

Finally, you will need to complete the [self/peer evaluation (MSWord)](PeerReview.doc) form.  If you are working on an individual project, you can leave the sections where you would evaluate your teammates blank.

# Submitting

Share your report with both instructors (<djhake2@ycp.edu> and <dhovemey@ycp.edu>), granting write permission.

Turn in a hard copy of the self/peer evaluation at the beginning of the demo session (on May 7th).  If you want to turn it in before then, that's fine.
