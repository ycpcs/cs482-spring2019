**Final Self/Peer Evaluation:** Tuesday, May 14th, by 7:00 am via email to Professor Hake and Dr. Babcock.

# Deliverables

Your main task is to demonstrate the final version of your project, in conjunction with the Engineering Capstone Team.  The demonstration should focus on the features addressing the requirements for Milestone 4, but should also incorporate important features from previous milestones in order to give an overall assessment of what your system is capable of.  This presentation will showcase the final working, fully-integrated Radio Telescope for an audience to include the YCAS members, the director of York County Parks, faculty members, family and friends of the Radio Telescope team members, students, alumni, and industry partners.  It will be the culminating experience of your college career.

Each team is also responsible for writing a comprehensive document similar in scope to the final presentations and technical reports that you provided for CS 481 in the Fall.  Follow the [CS481 guidelines](https://ycpcs.github.io/cs481-fall2018-102-RT/assign/assign07.html).

**Use Google Docs to write the report.  There will be no draft report submission - your report should be complete and thoroughly proofread.  Submit the final report in PDF format via email to your instructors by the due date listed above.

Finally, you will need to complete the [self/peer evaluation](PeerReview.pdf) form.  If you are working on an individual project, you can leave the sections where you would evaluate your teammates blank.  [Download the MS Word version](PeerReview.doc), fill it out, and submit in PDF format.

# Submitting

Share your report with both instructors (<djhake2@ycp.edu> and <dbabcock@ycp.edu>), grant edit permission.

For all projects, email your self/peer evaluation to your instructors by the due date listed above.
