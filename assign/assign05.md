# Your task

Your main task is to demonstrate the final version of your project.  The demonstration should focus on the features addressing the requirements for Milestone 4, but should also incorporate important features from previous milestones in order to give an overall assessment of what your system is capable of.

**Projects other than the Radio Telescope:** You or your group are also resposible for writing a 4-5 page report documenting what you accomplished.  The report should focus on what you learned in the experience of working on the project.  Suggested outline:

* Background and problem description
* Overview of design
* Implementation experience
* Assessment of final product

**Radio Telescope Project:** Each team is responsible for giving a presentation/demo and writing a comprehensive document similar in scope to the final presentations and technical reports that you provided for CS 481 in the Fall.  Follow the [CS481 guidelines](https://ycpcs.github.io/cs481-fall2018-102-RT/assign/assign07.html).

**For all projects:** Use Google Docs to write the report.  There will be no draft report submission - your report should be complete and thoroughly proofread.  Submit the final report in PDF format via email to your instructors by the due date listed above.

Finally, you will need to complete the [self/peer evaluation (MSWord)](PeerReview.doc) form.  If you are working on an individual project, you can leave the sections where you would evaluate your teammates blank.

# Submitting

Share your report with both instructors (<djhake2@ycp.edu> and <dbabcock@ycp.edu>), grant edit permission.

For all projects, email your self/peer evaluation to your instructors by the due date listed above.  If you want to turn it in before then, that's fine.
