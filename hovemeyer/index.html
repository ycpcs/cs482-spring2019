				<td class="message">Dave - When Dave Babcock was looking for the second full-time faculty member for the Computer Science program back in 2006, Dave initially recruited me for that position.  Ultimately, you got that spot, and he truly could not have found a better person to fulfill that role.  A decade later, when I was offered the full-time CS instructor position at York College, I only knew the bare basics of Java, and nothing of web development.  Ironically, I learned the material and how to teach CS201 and CS320 through your CS course websites, and by sitting in on your Summer 2015 CS201 course to also see how you presented OOP in Java, and how you ran the class.  You then spent countless hours helping me prepare for my first semester teaching SW Engineering, and continued to do so, even while you were on sabbatical that semester.  You helped carry me through my entire first year of teaching.  Whatever impact I&#39;ve had on the Computer Science program, whatever enhancements I&#39;ve made to SW Engineering, they are because I&#39;ve always had a great vantage point standing upon your shoulders from the moment I arrived at Kinsley.  I couldn&#39;t have done any of this without your gracious help, instruction, and guidance.  It will not be the same without you here - you are a founding member of the York College CS Program, and your name will always be synonymous with this place and this program.  I wish you much good luck and good fortune at Johns Hopkins - Kinsley will be a far poorer place for your absence, but Hopkins will be a far richer place for your presence.  You have become (and always will be) a teacher, a mentor, and a friend to me, and you will always have my eternal gratitude for all of your guidance in helping me settle into my dream job.</td>

				<td class="message">Dave, when I hired you as the second CS faculty back in 2006, little did I know what an amazing decision that would turn out to be. Together we created a program that I feel is second to none that I could never have done without all your dedication, effort, and support. Through all the curricular development, migration to Github for course content, the implementation of Marmoset and Cloudcoder, and the entire ABET assessment process, just to name a few, your contribution to the YCP CS program is immeasurable except in terms of the tremendous student success that has been a result. Even from the early days in Grantley Hall with the "interesting" senior design groups we had throughout the years ("arroooga...") to almost burning down Kinsley, I have always respected you as a colleague, appreciated you as a scholar, and valued you as a friend. It would be an understatement to say that this program is what it is because of you and will not be the same without you. But I wish you the best going forward in this new phase of your career and hope you come back to the place we have called home for the past 12 years, you will be deeply missed.</td>
