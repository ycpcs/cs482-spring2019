				<td class="message">Professor Hovemeyer was my first introduction to the CS program in my fall semester of freshman year for Creative Computing, and then again in cs201. His enthusiasm and genuine understanding of students really excited me for my classes in the future. Additionally, in creative computing, he introduced a way of making MIDI music with code, which inspired me to create a small video game project with a short soundtrack, and a demo of the project can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_aCijb51a4. Thank you professor Hovemeyer for inspiring me to work on my projects and introducing me to the CS program of York College.</td>

				<td class="message">Dr. Hovemeyer - While I only had you for one class, CS330 in Fall 2018, the instruction you gave was invaluable to my experience as a student of computer science and really helped to get me into the swing of things here at York after transferring from my previous university. I wasn&#39;t an A student - never really have been - but the challenge presented, and the help you gave in understanding the concepts, only bolstered my ability as a programmer. I wish you all the luck in the world on your future endeavours.</td>

Every time I came into his office to ask question, he always explained it thoroughly so there was no way I couldn&#39;t understand. He also never complained about me coming in so often.
